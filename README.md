A Python program that collects student data and generates formatted report cards with grade calculations.

## Features
- Interactive data input for multiple students
- Calculates total marks and percentage
- Assigns grades based on performance
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Clean, formatted output

## How It Works
1. Program starts by prompting for student details:
   - Name
   - Roll number
   - Marks for 5 subjects (Math, Physics, Urdu, English, Computer)
2. After each student, asks if you want to add more
3. When finished, generates detailed report cards showing:
   - Individual subject marks
   - Total marks out of 500
   - Percentage
   - Grade (A+, A, B, C, or F)

## Grading System
| Percentage | Grade |
|------------|-------|
| 80%+       | A+    |
| 70-79%     | A     |
| 60-69%     | B     |
| 50-59%     | C     |
| 40-49%     | F     |
| Below 40%  | Fail  |
